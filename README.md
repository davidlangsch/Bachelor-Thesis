This repository is part of my Bachelor Thesis "From Simulation to Recommendation: Analyzing the Effect of Event Log Features on Process Discovery".

It provides the synthetic event logs generated by the event log simulator GEDI (https://github.com/lmu-dbs/gedi), as well as the code created for deriving process models from them and evaluating these logs using various conformance metrics.
