This repository is part of my Bachelor's thesis "From Simulation to Recommendation: Analyzing the Effect of Event Log Features on Process Discovery."
It provides the synthetic event logs generated by an event log simulator called GEDI (https://github.com/lmu-dbs/gedi), as well as the code used for evaluating and analyzing these logs using various conformance metrics.
